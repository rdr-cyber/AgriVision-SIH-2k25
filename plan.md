- Elevate overall visual design to a polished, modern aesthetic that aligns with a professional brand identity, including a cohesive color system, refined typography, consistent spacing, and high-quality imagery/icons across all pages.
- Establish a clear information architecture and navigation system that supports intuitive discovery of key content (e.g., Home, About/Company, Services/Products, Case Studies/Portfolio, Pricing, Blog/Resources, Contact) with consistent header, footer, and breadcrumb patterns.
- Define a compelling homepage that communicates value proposition, primary calls-to-action, key offerings, social proof (testimonials/logos), and a concise overview of capabilities, with sections that can be repurposed across the site.
- Specify core content templates for primary page types (e.g., Services, Case Study/Portfolio, Blog Post, About/Team, Contact) including required content blocks (hero, overview, features/benefits, media gallery, FAQs, CTAs, forms, metadata) to ensure consistency and scalability.
- Set baseline user experience standards including responsive behavior for mobile/tablet/desktop, accessible interactions and content, fast perceived performance, clear CTAs on every page, and trust-building elements (policies, contact methods, social links, newsletter opt-in).
