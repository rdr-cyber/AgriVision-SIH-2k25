# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Repository Name Suggestion
Based on your project naming preferences, here are suggested names for your GitHub repository:

1. **Agrivision-Herb-Traceability** (Recommended - concise and descriptive)
2. **Agrivision-AI-Blockchain-Platform** (More detailed)
3. **Herb-Traceability-Platform** (Generic but clear)

## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter your chosen repository name (e.g., `Agrivision-Herb-Traceability`)
4. Add a description (optional): "AI & Blockchain Powered Herb Traceability Platform"
5. Keep the repository as "Public" (unless you prefer private)
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
After creating the repository, replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` in the following commands with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
# Set the remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Alternatively, if you haven't set the remote yet:
```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all the files and folders uploaded
3. The README.md file will be displayed as the main page content
4. You can now share the repository link with others

## Repository Structure
The repository includes:
- Complete Next.js application with all features implemented
- AI chatbot with server-side API integration
- Enhanced authentication system with forgot password and OTP verification
- QR code scanning functionality
- Role-based access control for 5 user types
- E-commerce system with shopping cart and checkout
- Documentation files explaining all features

## Post-Deployment Notes
- The .env file is intentionally excluded from the repository for security
- Users will need to create their own .env file with GEMINI_API_KEY
- The .env.example file provides guidance on required environment variables

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure you have the correct repository URL
2. Verify you have proper permissions for the repository
3. Check that you're using the correct GitHub credentials
4. Make sure you have internet connectivity

For any authentication issues, you may need to use GitHub CLI or set up SSH keys for smoother authentication.
