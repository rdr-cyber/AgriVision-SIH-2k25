# Payment System Implementation

This document describes the payment system implementation for the AgriVision platform.

## Overview

The payment system allows consumers to purchase herbal products through a secure checkout process. It includes:

1. Shopping cart functionality
2. Multi-step checkout process
3. Payment processing with validation
4. Order confirmation

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Cart Context** ([src/context/cart-context.tsx](file:///C:/Users/rajde/OneDrive/Desktop/Smart_India_Hackathon_2025_Project/src/context/cart-context.tsx))
   - Manages the shopping cart state
   - Persists cart data in localStorage
   - Provides functions to add, remove, and update cart items

2. **Payment Service** ([src/lib/payment-service.ts](file:///C:/Users/rajde/OneDrive/Desktop/Smart_India_Hackathon_2025_Project/src/lib/payment-service.ts))
   - Handles payment processing logic
   - Validates payment details
   - Simulates payment gateway integration

3. **UI Components**
   - Cart page ([src/app/consumer/cart/page.tsx](file:///C:/Users/rajde/OneDrive/Desktop/Smart_India_Hackathon_2025_Project/src/app/consumer/cart/page.tsx))
   - Checkout page ([src/app/consumer/checkout/page.tsx](file:///C:/Users/rajde/OneDrive/Desktop/Smart_India_Hackathon_2025_Project/src/app/consumer/checkout/page.tsx))

## Features

### Shopping Cart

- Add products to cart from the search page
- Update item quantities
- Remove items from cart
- View cart total and item count
- Clear entire cart

### Checkout Process

The checkout process is divided into three steps:

1. **Shipping Information**
   - Collect customer shipping details
   - Address, city, state, ZIP, country, phone

2. **Payment Method**
   - Credit/Debit card payment
   - Digital wallet options (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - UPI payment option

3. **Order Review**
   - Review all order details
   - Confirm shipping address
   - Verify order total

### Payment Processing

- Card payment validation
- Secure payment processing simulation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Order confirmation

## Implementation Details

### Cart Context

The cart context provides a global state management solution for the shopping cart:

```typescript
const {
  cartItems,      // Array of items in cart
  addToCart,      // Function to add items
  removeFromCart, // Function to remove items
  updateQuantity, // Function to update item quantities
  clearCart,      // Function to clear the cart
  getTotalItems,  // Function to get total item count
  getTotalPrice   // Function to get total price
} = useCart();
```

### Payment Service

The payment service handles all payment-related logic:

```typescript
// Process a payment
const result = await PaymentService.processPayment(paymentDetails);

// Validate card payment details
const validation = PaymentService.validateCardPayment(cardDetails);
```

### UI Components

#### Cart Page
- Displays all items in the cart
- Allows quantity adjustments
- Shows order summary with pricing
- Provides checkout button

#### Checkout Page
- Multi-step form for collecting shipping and payment information
- Payment method selection
- Order review before processing
- Payment processing with loading states

## Security Considerations

1. **Client-Side Validation**
   - Card number, expiry date, and CVV validation
   - Proper error messaging

2. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive payment data is not stored
   - All processing is simulated in this demo

3. **Secure Communication**
   - In a production environment, all payment data would be transmitted over HTTPS
   - PCI DSS compliance would be required for real payment processing

## Integration Points

### Payment Gateways

The system is designed to integrate with various payment gateways:

- Stripe
- PayPal
- Razorpay
- Paytm

To integrate with a real payment gateway, you would:

1. Replace the mock [PaymentService](file:///C:/Users/rajde/OneDrive/Desktop/Smart_India_Hackathon_2025_Project/src/lib/payment-service.ts#L23-L75) with actual API calls
2. Implement proper authentication and security measures
3. Handle webhooks for payment confirmations
4. Add proper error handling and retry logic

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Implement actual payment processing with Stripe, PayPal, or other providers

2. **Advanced Payment Features**
   - Saved payment methods
   - Subscription support
   - Partial payments
   - Payment plans

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Tokenization of payment data
   - 3D Secure authentication
   - Fraud detection

4. **Order Management**
   - Order history and tracking
   - Refund processing
   - Invoice generation

5. **Multi-Currency Support**
   - Currency conversion
   - Localization

## Usage

To use the payment system:

1. Browse products on the search page
2. Add items to cart using the "Add to Cart" button
3. Navigate to the cart page to review items
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Complete the shipping and payment information
6. Review the order and place it

The system provides real-time feedback throughout the process and handles errors gracefully.
