## Technical Notes

### Environment Variables
The AI chatbot uses the existing `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable configured in the `.env` file.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies were required for these features. The implementation uses existing libraries:
- `genkit` for AI integration
- `lucide-react` for icons
- Existing UI components from the component library

### Security Considerations
- All verification processes are simulated in this demo version
- In a production environment, actual email/SMS sending would be implemented
- OTPs are generated client-side for demonstration purposes only
- Password reset functionality would require backend implementation for security

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Implement actual email/SMS sending services
   - Add database storage for password reset tokens
   - Implement proper session management

2. **Advanced Chatbot Features**
   - Conversation history persistence
   - Multi-language support
   - Voice input capabilities
   - Integration with documentation for contextual help

3. **Enhanced Verification**
   - Rate limiting for verification requests
   - Multiple verification attempts tracking
   - Biometric authentication options
