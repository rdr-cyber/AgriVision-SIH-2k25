# QR Code Scanning Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Scan QR Code" option was not working in the consumer tracking page. The UI had a button but no actual functionality was implemented.

## Root Cause
1. The QR code scanning functionality was completely missing from the codebase
2. No camera access or QR code processing logic was implemented
3. The "Scan QR Code" button was just a placeholder with no event handler

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Required Dependencies
- Installed `jsqr` library for client-side QR code decoding
- This library works entirely in the browser with no external API calls

### 2. Enhanced Consumer Tracking Page
Modified `src/app/consumer/tracking/page.tsx` to include:

#### New Features:
- Camera access using MediaDevices API
- Real-time QR code scanning using jsQR library
- Modal dialog interface for scanning
- Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Error handling for camera permissions

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added state management for scanning process
- Implemented video stream handling
- Created frame-by-frame scanning loop
- Added cleanup functions for proper resource management

### 3. User Experience
- Click "Scan QR Code" button to start scanning
- Camera permission prompt appears
- Live camera feed is displayed in a modal
- QR code is automatically detected and processed
- Scanner stops after successful detection
- Manual cancel option available

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/consumer/tracking/page.tsx` - Main implementation
2. `package.json` - Added jsqr dependency (via npm install)

## How to Test
1. Navigate to the consumer tracking page (`/consumer/tracking`)
2. Click the "Scan QR Code" button
3. Grant camera permissions when prompted
4. Point your camera at any QR code
5. The scanned data will be displayed in an alert

## Security & Privacy
- All scanning happens locally in the browser
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- Camera access requires explicit user permission
- Resources are properly cleaned up after use

## Future Improvements
1. Integrate scanned QR codes with batch lookup system
2. Add scan history for consumers
3. Implement offline scanning capabilities
4. Add support for custom QR code designs
